Released a first version of my scripting language [DenrimScript](https://github.com/markusmoenig/DenrimScript) which features CPU AND GPU support via compute shader functions. Based on the great book [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com) from [@munificentbob](https://twitter.com/munificentbob).
